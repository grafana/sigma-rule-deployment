# Story (Outcome/Output) (Required)
*The “why” of the ticket. This is not a user story per say, but a statement (1-2 sentences) of the higher-level goal we’re trying to achieve*

# Context
*General context of the ticket. This should be sized relative to the complexity of the ticket. This can include subsections as needed. This should include anything needed to understand the priority of the ticket, and to allow for the building of the implementation, testing plan. Documentation and other resources useful for understanding the ticket should be included here.*

# Definition of Done (Required)
*All of the final deliverables of the ticket. We assume our typical definition of done applies here, so no need to list out things like doc updates and unit tests*

# Implementation Plan
*Document how we plan to implement this issue, to the level of depth required for the ticket. Very basic tickets will have nothing here, while complex epics will have a significant amount that branch into many subtasks. Use this to plan your implementation. If relevant, note any alternatives you considered and quickly why you chose your solution.*

# Testing Plan
*How we plan to test the ticket (if applicable). Unit tests & integration tests are assumed, but details on them can be added if significant. Descriptions of how to validate the change and what automated end-to-end testing to add should be included.*

# Dependencies (Required)
*What teams, systems, etc do we depend on? What other tickets do we have? What poses a risk to completing this in the capacity we estimated?*
